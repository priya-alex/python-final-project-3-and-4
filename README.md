PYTHON (NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB):

2. Retail Sales Data Analysis (CSV Dataset)
 Problem: A retail company wants to analyze sales patterns and customer behavior.
 Requirements:
1.	Load a CSV dataset using Pandas and perform data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates).
2.	Use NumPy to calculate statistical measures (mean, median, std deviation of sales).
3.	Perform grouping and aggregation (e.g., sales by region, sales by product category).
4.	Create time series analysis (monthly revenue trend).
5.	Visualize insights with Matplotlib (bar chart for top products, line chart for revenue trend, pie chart for region sales).

PYTHON (NUMPY, PANDAS, SEABORN):

4. Customer Spending Behavior Analysis
 Problem: A shopping mall wants to analyze customer demographics and spending habits.
 Requirements:
1.	Load customer dataset (CSV with age, gender, income, spending score).
2.	Clean dataset → handle nulls, duplicates, and outliers.
3.	Use NumPy to calculate descriptive stats (avg income, median spending, std dev of scores).
4.	Use Pandas groupby to analyze spending score by age group & gender.
5.	Create Seaborn visualizations:
o	countplot → customer distribution by gender
o	boxplot → spending score vs. income
o	heatmap → correlation matrix
o	scatterplot → age vs. spending score
